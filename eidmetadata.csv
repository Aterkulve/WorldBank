Second, changes in food consumption toward raw and undercooked meats, unpasteurized milk, and other uncooked foods is increasing the accidental exposure of humans to these animal pathogens. Finally, the use of raw foods as ‘‘alternative’’ therapies for seriously ill patients [10] brings together the vehicles and the most susceptible hosts.

In 1986, this led to the mass movement of people and their livestock away from the region, which had consequences for the local agriculture and ecology.  After the extensive emigration from the Soroti region, the previously cultivated landreverted to its natural habitat, and one result of this was that it provided an increased habitat for the tsetse fly.  In the 1990s, stability returned to this region of Uganda with repopulation and the return of livestock.  Large-scale agricultural programs funded by the Ugandan government and aid donors, were implemented in the regionboth to restock livestock and to further develop cattle production.  Two key events took place as a result of the restocking: (1) cattle were reintroduced into an area infested with tsetse flies, and (2) some of the introduced cattle originated from endemic areas and were carrying T b rhodesiense","civil unrest","war and famine","war and famine","war and famine","cattle introduction","migration of people and livestock","wild game, domestic cattle, carnivores (lions, hyenas)","Unspecified","Unspecified","Taylor et al.","",0,0,1,1,"HED_328.shp",TRUE

One of the strains was isolated from a sample of blood from a refugee in Burigi Camp, Ngara, in north eastern Tanzania; another strain was isolated from a health worker at the Uganda Virus Research Institute, working with the Rakai Project on HIV in Rakai district; while the third strain was isolated from a pool of 50 Anopheles funestus mosquitoes collected during the O’nyong-nyong virus fever epidemic in Rakai district in 1996/1997. Conclusions:Bwamba fever may be more common than it is usually thought to be. It is often mistaken for malaria and because it is a mild infection, many people do not go to hospital when infected.

However, the obser vation that the seasonal pattern was clearly different in 2002 in the countries that had increased numbers of outbreaks suggests that there was a true increase.  Also, harmonised surveillance has not directly affected national surveillance systems.
